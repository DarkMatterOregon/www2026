        <h3>AI-Assisted Modernization</h3>
        <p>
          Experienced engineers using modern AI tools to dramatically reduce the cost
          of modernizing legacy systems. We accelerate discovery, documentation, and
          rewriting of old code — in any language, even MS Access.

      <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Legacy .NET Modernization</h3>
        <p>
          We extract the business logic from aging .NET Framework, VB6, and legacy apps
          and deliver modern, maintainable Blazor WebAssembly applications.

        <h3>Azure Cloud Migration</h3>
        <p>
          Move your on-premise .NET applications to Azure — serverless, containerized,
          or hybrid. We right-size infrastructure for government budgets.

        <h3>Team Enablement</h3>
        <p>
          We don't just deliver software. We work alongside your agency's team,

          modernized system.
